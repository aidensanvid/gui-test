Title of the Project: The Matrix

High Level Description:
a) 2048 is a single player game, in a 4x4 grid where you add up adjacent tiles. The user interacts with the app via a GUI.
b) The context in which the app will be used is for entertainment purposes / leisure.
c) Constraints:`
1. The game will be played on a 4x4 grid, with the user having to slide the tiles in the grid to combine them.
2. The game will end when the grid is full and no more moves can be made or the game will end when you have a single block with a value of 2048 on your grid. 
3. The user will have the option to restart the game.

Type of App: Game (in C)
